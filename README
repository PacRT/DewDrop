Get and install docker on your machine. For ubuntu install apparmor package to harden the security.

when you are in this folder run

sudo docker build -t dewdrop .
It will take some long time to build for the first time

sudo docker run -p 8883:8883 -ti dewdrop
this will expose the secure mqtt over 8883 port of the host machine

At this point check the config/default for valid certs and other crypto configurations

then run

pm2 start mqtt-server.js
Monitor the log

pm2 logs mqtt-server --raw | bunyan
