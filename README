before running this server in your local env follow the steps below
run pkiTLScacerts.sh - it will create the TLS CA certs chain
edit the pkiservercerts.sh and place your proper domain name and then run pkiservercerts.sh
then run pkiclientcerts.sh

 OR

Bring your own certificates

You will see the dtrace warning while running the broker. Errot looks like this 
{ [Error: Cannot find module './build/default/DTraceProviderBindings'] code: 'MODULE_NOT_FOUND' }

Using npm install --no-optional seems to fix it, raising a ticket about it - needs to be solved sometimes in future - not a blocker.
